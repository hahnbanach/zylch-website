        <h3>Your Data</h3>
        <p>You retain ownership of your data. By using Zylch, you grant us a license to process your data as necessary to provide the Service, as described in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>5. Disclaimers</h2>

        <h3>As-Is Service</h3>
        <p><strong>ZYLCH IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</strong> We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or meet your specific requirements.</p>

        <h3>AI Limitations</h3>
        <p>We do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or appropriateness of AI-generated content or actions. The AI may make mistakes. You are responsible for reviewing and verifying all communications sent on your behalf.</p>

        <h3>No Professional Advice</h3>
        <p>Zylch does not provide legal, financial, medical, or other professional advice. Any information or suggestions provided by the Service should not be relied upon as professional guidance.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, HAHN BANACH AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR:</strong></p>

        </ul>

        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so some of the above may not apply to you.</p>

        <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>

        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Hahn Banach from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from:</p>

            <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
            <li>Your violation of any rights of third parties</li>
            <li>Communications sent through Zylch on your behalf</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>By Us</h3>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>

        <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes by posting updated Terms on our website. Your continued use of Zylch after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h2>10. General</h2>

        <h3>Governing Law</h3>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

        <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of Zylch shall be resolved through binding arbitration in Delaware, except that either party may seek injunctive relief in court for intellectual property matters.</p>

        <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
        <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Hahn Banach regarding Zylch.</p>

        <h3>Severability</h3>

        <h3>No Waiver</h3>
        <p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not waive our right to enforce it later.</p>
