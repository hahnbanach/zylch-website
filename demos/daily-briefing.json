Calls are going straight to voicemail instead of the AI assistant.\n\nWe have a product launch today and expecting high call volume. This is critical for us.\n\nCan someone look at this ASAP?\n\n- Robert\"\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nCONTEXT FROM YOUR HISTORY:\n• TechStart is a paying customer since August\n• Robert is the CTO, usually handles technical issues himself\n• They had a similar issue in September - was an API key rotation\n• Their account is $2,400/month - mid-tier customer\n\n💡 SUGGESTION: This sounds like it could be the same API key issue. Should I draft an immediate response with troubleshooting steps while you escalate to engineering?"

Are you available for a follow-up call this week?\n\nBest,\nJohn\n\nP.S. - Hope you had a great Thanksgiving!"
