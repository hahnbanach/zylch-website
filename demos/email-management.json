We're hoping to go live before our January board meeting (Jan 15).\"\n\n2. SUPPORT QUESTION:\n\"What does 'priority support' include exactly? Our team works across 3 time zones (NYC, London, Singapore) - will we have coverage for all?\"\n\nCONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS EMAILS:\n- Lisa is pushing for faster implementation (board pressure)\n- She mentioned they're comparing you with two other vendors\n- Marcus (CFO) is the budget holder, recently got involved\n\nWant me to draft a response addressing both questions?"

We've done accelerated implementations before for clients with board deadlines. I'll work with our delivery team to prioritize Henderson Corp.\n\nTo make 4 weeks work, we'd need:\n- Kickoff call by December 9\n- Your IT team available for 2 integration sessions\n- Sign-off on requirements by December 13\n\n**Support Coverage:**\nOur Enterprise plan includes 24/7 support with guaranteed response times:\n- Critical issues: 15 minutes\n- High priority: 1 hour\n- Standard: 4 hours\n\nWe have support engineers in Austin, Dublin, and Singapore, so your teams in all three time zones will have local-hours coverage.\n\nMarcus - I'm copying you since I saw your note about the budget process. Happy to provide any additional documentation you need for approval.\n\nShould we schedule a quick call this week to lock in the timeline?\n\nBest,\nJohn"
